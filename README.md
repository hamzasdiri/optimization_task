# Performance Measurement and Chart Display
This repository contains code to measure the performance of two sorting algorithms, original Bubble Sort and an optimized sorting method, and display the results in a comparison chart. This README provides instructions on how to run and set up the code.

## Prerequisites
Before you can run the code, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Node.js (for running the code)
A modern web browser (for displaying the chart)
## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/hamzasdiri/optimization_task.git
Change to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd performance-measurement
Install the necessary Node.js packages by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
## Running the Code
To measure and display the performance of the sorting algorithms and view the results in a chart, follow these steps:

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the code using Node.js with the following command:

bash
Copy code
node performanceMeasurement.js
After running the code, you will see the execution times for both the original Bubble Sort and the optimized sorting method displayed in the terminal.

Additionally, open the index.html file in a web browser to view the performance comparison chart.

## Files
performanceMeasurement.js: Contains the JavaScript code for measuring and comparing the performance of the sorting algorithms and displaying the chart.
comparison.html: An HTML file that renders the chart in a web browser.
